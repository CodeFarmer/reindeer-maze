** Thrilling Action Shot

[[action_shot.png]]

** Running

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein run 8080
#+END_SRC

...will start a GUI on your laptop, and a server on port 8080.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
telnet localhost 8080
#+END_SRC

...will act as a simple client, so you can connect and explore.

You can also set the size of the maze, using:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
lein run 8080 50 10
#+END_SRC

...for a maze 50 squares wide, 10 high.
